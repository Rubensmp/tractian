## Improvement points

- Review my code for any potential refactoring to improve readability and maintainability.
- Take some time to work on repeated styles on tailwind
- Unit Tests: Increase the coverage of unit tests using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
- Write integration tests to ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.
- End-to-End Tests: Implement end-to-end testing with tools like Cypress to simulate user interactions and catch bugs.
- Utilizing Docker for Project Improvement: Docker ensures that all team members work in an identical environment, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem.

This are some of the points that i would improve.
